# InfoClimatDisplayer
Simple app displaying InfoClimat data


## Process

The app loads weather data from InfoClimat.fr, and displays a list of predictions. Selecting a time displays the details (humidity, rain chance, pressure).

It also gives a warning if the weather gets freezing in the prediction period, and advises the user to dress warmly if it's cold.

It also attributes the weather data according to the InfoClimat.fr API terms and conditions.
